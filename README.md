## How It Works

OWF has two main parts:

### 1. The Finder
- Scans random IPs looking for unknown websites
- Filters out common sites to find the obscure ones
- Saves everything it finds to `found_websites.txt`
- Shows you stats while it works
- Stop anytime with Ctrl+C

### 2. The Viewer
- Browse through everything you've found
- See screenshots of each site
- Visit interesting sites directly
- Dark theme for late-night exploring
- Pages through your discoveries

## Tips for Finding Cool Stuff

- Use "Advanced Settings" to filter for specific kinds of sites
- Try filtering titles to find particular pages (like "personal blog" or "home server")
- Look for specific server types to find hobby projects

## Important Notes

- This is for exploring the internet and finding interesting sites
- Some websites might not like automated visitors
- Consider using a VPN while scanning
